# Swapmeet

# About 
Creating a website for my parent's succesfuly business. They have been working at the Bel-Air Swapmeet for the last 30 years and have built an amazing career. 
They focus on selling general house cleaning items as well as pet supplies and toiletries. 

I was motivated to create this website because they are hard working parents and business owners who  have come a long way. I am extremely proud of my parents 
and am thankful that they took the time to build an amazing business to has taught me so many skills, such as responsibility, attention to client and attention to detail.
